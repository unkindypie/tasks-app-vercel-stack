# Task tracking on a 2024 stack

Just a dummy app I made in a couple of evenings playing around with a new NextJS Server Actions update and React server components.

## Stack

- NextJS
- React Query
- Drizzle ORM
- Vercel Cloud
- Firebase Auth

## Getting Started

1. `docker-compose up`
2. `npx drizzle-kit migrate`
3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Todo

1. Services/server actions structure
2. Server-side validation
3. Cliend-side server error handling / toasts
4. Transactions
5. Firebase Auth
